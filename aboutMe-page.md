# About Me
### Shayla Vo
I graduated from Ohio State University in 2022, with a bachelors in International Studies: *Security and Intelligence*, and a minor in Information Systems.

By taking this Swift course, I'm able to expand on the knowledge I gained while in school. This course has allowed me to work on projects that I can show as proof of my understanding of a language.
